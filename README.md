## INTRO STATEMENT

> I love IT from whole life, even read journals like Hacker in 00’s when a real PC was just a dream. In university my most favorite activities were coding in Fortran, 3D modeling in SOLIDWORKS and doing any type of course work where I can use Mathcad (it resembles me Jupyter Note now).

> I started working in the university department from the 3rd year and that defined my career trajectory for 12 years front. But I wanted much more, and after I took data courses, starting from Data Science to Data Engineering I finally know that working with information, data bases, finding business insights and analytic is a field where I want to be and where I want to realize myself.

> Currently, I working in data-driven company – Mediascope.
