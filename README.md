## INTRO STATEMENT

> It was a long thorny path to DS/DE for me. My first language was Fortran, then C#. I used them at university, but it wasn't real IT. Then I tried python and ML, and found out that the DS/DE combines all things I like to do. Now, I have aim to become professional in this area.
> 
> I had started learning DS/DE in 27.10.2021 from different sources: Yandex.Practicum, Coursera, Pluralsight, HackerRank, Stepik, YouTube, ODS and etc.
