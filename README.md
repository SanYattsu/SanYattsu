## INTRO STATEMENT

> I was fascinated by technology — back in the 2000s, I devoured magazines like Hacker even before owning a real PC. That curiosity led me to university, where I thrived on coding in Fortran, 3D modeling in SOLIDWORKS, and solving complex problems in Mathcad (which, resembles me of Jupyter Notebook).
> 
> I began my career in academia, working at a university department from my third year onward — a path that shaped my professional life for the next 12 years. But I always wanted more. When I discovered the world of data—from Data Science to Data Engineering — everything clicked. Working with data, uncovering business insights, and turning raw information (Prometheus metrics included) into actionable intelligence became my true calling.
> 
> Today, I’m working at Mediascope, a data-driven company where I get to solve real-world problems through DevOps practices.
